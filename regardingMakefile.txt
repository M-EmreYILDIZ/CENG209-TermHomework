Since i only have a single .c file I did not create a Makefile for compilation. But I created a compile.bat file for compilation.
It resides within the term homework folder.
Also if you have already used the compile.bat there is also run.bat to run the game.

All that is needed is to type ./compile or .\compile according to your OS.
Also ./run or .\run for the run.bat file
